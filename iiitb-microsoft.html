      <h2>A Collaborative and Complimentary Partnership</h2>
      <p>
        The AI Innovation and Inclusion Initiative (A4I) is a collaboration between <b>Microsoft</b> as innovation enablers, and <b>IIIT-Bangalore</b> as the impact partner. The initiative combines Microsoft’s cutting-edge AI capabilities and innovations with IIIT-B’s expertise in research and field-driven deployment to transform proven innovations into scalable Digital Public Goods (DPGs). A4I provides a structured framework for governance, partnerships, and scale, enabling high-impact AI solutions to reach underserved communities effectively.<br /><br />
      
        The value that each partner brings to the table is summarized below.

      <h2>Microsoft</h2>
      <p>
        Microsoft has a range of research assets in societal impact domains such as education, agriculture, healthcare, and accessibility, which have demonstrated the impact of these innovations on a small and medium scale, with some (like 
        <a href="karya.html">Karya</a>) even successfully spinning off to become independent, self-sustaining entities. However, scaling these assets beyond successful pilots has been stymied by the lack of resources, a reliably supporting scaling infrastructure, and expertise at various levels.<br /><br />
      
        The AI Innovation and Inclusion Initiative strongly aligns with Microsoft India’s strategic priorities by addressing the problems in the public-sector priority states in India. States such as Karnataka, Telangana or Rajasthan are directly targeted by the project interventions being scaled up through A4I.<br /><br />
      
	Microsoft brings the following strengths to the initiative:
      <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>
          <b>Dedicated funding from Microsoft Philanthropies</b> to support the scaling of technology innovations and enable rigorous research on societal impact and outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Thought leadership in developing AI solutions</b> for the public good, reflecting Microsoft’s deep commitment to inclusion, equity, and empowering underserved communities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A portfolio of proven, research-backed innovations</b> from Microsoft Research, ready for adaptation and deployment at scale.

      <!-- IIIT-B Section -->
      <h2>International Institute of Information Technology, Bengaluru (IIIT-B)</h2>
      <p>
        IIIT-B is the <b>highest-ranked institute in contributions to DPGs</b> within India and globally.<br /><br />
 
        <a href="mosip.html">MOSIP</a> (Modular Open Source Identity Platform) was nurtured and incubated at IIITB and has been taken to over 20 countries. IIIT-B has also developed and scaled projects  
        , through its <a href="ehrc.html">E-Health Research Centre (EHRC)</a>, such as  <a href="tele-manas.html">Tele Manas</a>, India's flagship digital mental health initiative, ensuring a user-friendly interface and seamless functionality. It can handle more than 10k phone calls per month.<br /> <br />

	For more than 12 years, it's <a href="citapp.html">Centre for Information Technology and Public Policy (CITAPP)</a> has been contributing to nurture and transform public policy and design approaches related to the use of digital technologies for underserved groups across social impact sectors such as education, health and nutrition, agriculture, livelihoods and employment.<br /><br />
